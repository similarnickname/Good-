<h2>CSS</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom:10px;"><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/"><strong>CSS</strong></a> is designed to enable
the separation of present
ation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
provide more flexibility and control in the specificat
ion of presentation characteristics, enable multiple
 web pages to share formatting by specifying the rele
vant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexi
ty and repetition in the structural content.</p>
<p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it
feasible to present the same markup page in different
 styles for different rendering methods, such as on-s
 creen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser
  or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile dev
  ices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
   if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<img src="cssphoto.jpg" width="70%"</p><p style="margin-top:10px;">[4]
The name cascading comes from the specified priorit
y scheme to determine which style rule applies if mo
re than one rule matches a particular element.</p> <p style="margin-top:10px;">This c
ascading priority scheme is predictable.</p><p>
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World W
ide Web Consortium (W3C).</p><p style="margin-top:10px;"> Internet media type (MIME t
ype) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318
(March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation
service for CSS documents.<p style="margin-top:10px;">[5]
In addition to HTML, other markup languages support t
he use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XU
L.</p>
