<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>often abbreviated as <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script"><strong>JS</strong></a>, is a programming language
that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.</p><p style="margin-bottom:10px;">[7]
JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
and first-class functions.</p><p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] JavaScript
enables interactive web pages and is an essential part
of web applications. The vast majority of websites use
it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major web
browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
it.<p></p style="margin-bottom:60px;"><img src="javascriptimg.jpg" width="70%"
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports even
t-driven, functional, and imperative programming style
s. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) fo
r working with text, dates, regular expressions, stand
ard data structures, and the ocument Object Model (DOM
). However, the language itself does not include any i
nput/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or gra
phics facilities, as the host environment (usually a
web browser) provides those APIs.</p><p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
Originally used only in web browsers, JavaScript engi
nes are also now embedded in server-side website depl
oyments and non-browser applications.</p><p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
Although there are similarities between JavaScript an
d Java, including language name, syntax, and respecti
ve standard libraries, the two languages are distinct
and differ greatly in design.</p>
